# User study

The questionnaire and the survey results for the article "A Unified Nanopublication Model for Effective and User-Friendly Access to the Elements of Scientific Publishing" by Cristina-Iulia Bucur, Tobias Kuhn and Davide Ceolin.

## Description of the user study

We sent this questionnaire to a total of 401 editors of journals that support open reviews, specifically Data Science, the Semantic Web Journal and PeerJ Computer Science. Out of the total 401 questionnaire requests sent, we received a total of 42 answers (10.5%). 

This user experiment involved editors to find out whether they consider the competency questions described in the article above important, and how useful they find our interface for getting an answer to these questions. For this study, we created a form that had two parts corresponding to the two parts of the study. We chose an article from our dataset that had a large number of review comments. For the first part, we asked for the importance of the competency questions using a Likert scale (from 1 to 5). For the second part, we provided static screenshots of our tool (the reviewer-oriented or the section-oriented view, depending on the question) together with a link to the live demo and asked about how useful the participants would find such a tool to answer the given competency question. The answers were on the same kind of a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
